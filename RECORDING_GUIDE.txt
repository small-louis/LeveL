GSR RECORDING GUIDE - Integrated Code System
================================================================================

OVERVIEW:
The integrated_code.py now supports structured experiment recording with:
- User ID tracking
- Three experiment phases (Baseline, Trial, Post)
- Intervention state blinding (State A/B)
- Single continuous recording session

================================================================================
GUI LAYOUT:
================================================================================

LEFT SIDE - GSR MONITOR:
------------------------
1. User ID Entry Box
   - Enter participant ID (e.g., P001, User01, etc.)
   - Required before recording starts

2. Intervention State Buttons
   - State A / State B buttons
   - Set BEFORE starting recording
   - Locked during recording (prevents accidental changes)
   - State A/B labels maintain blinding (researcher knows which is intervention)

3. Recording Controls
   - START RECORDING (green) / STOP & SAVE (red) button
   - Status display

4. Phase Transition Buttons
   - Baseline (light green) - Starting phase
   - Trial (yellow) - Main experiment phase
   - Post (light orange) - Post-experiment phase
   - Click during recording to mark phase transitions

5. Live GSR Plot
   - Shows current GSR value
   - During recording: displays Phase and State on plot

RIGHT SIDE - HAPTIC CONTROLS:
-----------------------------
- 6 motor controls (unchanged)
- BPM sliders, Lub/Dub effects, enable/disable
- Sync button

================================================================================
WORKFLOW:
================================================================================

BEFORE RECORDING:
1. Enter User ID in text box
2. Select intervention state (State A or State B)
3. Set up haptic motors as needed

DURING RECORDING:
1. Click "START RECORDING" (starts in Baseline phase)
2. Run baseline period
3. Click "Trial" button when starting trial phase
4. Run trial period
5. Click "Post" button when starting post-experiment phase
6. Run post-experiment period
7. Click "STOP & SAVE" when complete

AFTER RECORDING:
- File automatically saved to GSR-data/
- Filename format: gsr_UserID_StateA_TIMESTAMP.csv
  Example: gsr_P001_StateA_20251117_143052.csv

================================================================================
CSV OUTPUT FORMAT:
================================================================================

Columns:
- Time (s): Elapsed time since recording started
- Phase: Current phase (Baseline, Trial, or Post)
- State: Intervention state (A or B)
- GSR Value: Raw GSR sensor reading (0-4095)

Example:
Time (s), Phase, State, GSR Value
0.0, Baseline, A, 2750
0.1, Baseline, A, 2748
45.3, Trial, A, 2820
120.7, Post, A, 2765

================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES:
================================================================================

- User ID is REQUIRED before recording
- State selection is LOCKED during recording (prevents accidental changes)
- User ID entry is LOCKED during recording
- Recording always starts in Baseline phase
- Phase can be changed freely during recording
- All data saved to single CSV file with phase markers
- No data gaps between phases
