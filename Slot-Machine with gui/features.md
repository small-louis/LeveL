# Features of the Slot Machine Game

The Slot Machine Game offers several exciting features designed to provide an engaging and interactive experience for players. This document outlines the main features of the game and explains how each one enhances the gameplay.

## Key Features

### 1. Random Slot Machine Spins
Each spin of the slot machine is generated randomly, ensuring a unique outcome every time. This randomness simulates the unpredictability of real slot machines, making each game exciting and fair.

### 2. Multiple Betting Lines
Players can choose to bet on up to three lines, which increases their chances of winning. Betting on more lines can lead to higher potential rewards, but also increases the total bet amount.

### 3. Variable Bet Amounts
Players have the flexibility to place any bet amount they want:
- **Minimum Bet**: $10
- **Maximum Bet**: No limit (only constrained by available balance)

This feature allows players to manage their risk and strategy according to their preferences and available balance, with no artificial ceiling on bet sizes.

### 4. Symbol Values and Probabilities
The game includes a variety of symbols, each with different values and probabilities:
- **Symbols and Counts**:
  - A: 2
  - B: 4
  - C: 6
  - D: 8
- **Symbol Values**:
  - A: $5
  - B: $4
  - C: $3
  - D: $2

Higher value symbols are less frequent, adding an element of strategy to the game. Players must balance their bets and the lines they choose to maximize their potential winnings.

### 5. User-Friendly Command-Line Interface
The game is designed to be played in a command-line interface, providing clear prompts and feedback to the player. The interface is straightforward and easy to navigate, making the game accessible to users of all skill levels.

### 6. Winning Lines Display
After each spin, the game displays the winning lines and the total amount won. This feature provides instant feedback and enhances the excitement of the game.

### 7. Balance Management
Players start by depositing an amount of money and can continue playing as long as they have a positive balance. The game displays the current balance after each spin, helping players keep track of their funds.

### 8. Quit Option
Players can choose to quit the game at any time by pressing 'q'. This feature allows players to manage their time and end the game when they feel satisfied with their winnings or want to stop playing.

## Future Enhancements

The current version of the Slot Machine Game provides a solid foundation for further enhancements. Potential future features could include:
- **Progressive Jackpots**: Adding a jackpot feature that increases with each spin until a lucky player wins it.
- **Bonus Rounds**: Introducing special bonus rounds with unique rules and higher payouts.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Allowing multiple players to join the game and compete for the highest balance.
