# Requirements for Slot Machine GUI
# Python 3.x with tkinter (usually comes built-in)

# Note: tkinter is included with most Python installations
# If you're on Linux and tkinter is missing, install it with:
# - Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
# - Fedora: sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
# - Arch: sudo pacman -S tk

# No additional pip packages required!
